    <h1>Greetings, <%= @user.first_name %></h1>
    <p>Congratulations. You've been chosen to be part of what most holiday analysts are saying is the biggest thing to happen to Christmas since egg nog and mistletoe. </p>

    <p>Obviously, I'm talking about the annual meeting of the Secret Santa Society, the SSS, or as we like to call it, S3. You've probably never heard of it. That's sort of the point. </p>

    <p>Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If you choose to participate, visit <a href="<%= @url %>"><%= @url %></a> by end of day Friday, December 7th to accept this invitation.</li>
      <li>At midnight on Friday, December 7th you will receive an email with a Secret Santa match name. This is the person you will be buying a gift for.</li>
      <li>On Saturday, December 15th the S3 will convene (that means get together for a Christmas party) for our annual gathering at an undisclosed location, and gifts will be exchanged anonymously.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it. </p>

    <p>We don't have many rules, and if you’re familiar with the rules of Fight Club, you should be fine. </p>

    <p>Actually, just to be safe, here are the rules:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>You do not talk about Secret Santa Society.</li>
      <li>You DO NOT talk about Secret Santa Society. Not even with people you suspect may also be S3 members.</li>
      <li>If someone asks you directly about S3, you lie. Holiday lies are acceptable.</li>
      <li>Santas remain anonymous. You are free to investigate who your santa is after the exchange, but not before.</li>
      <li>Gifts must not exceed $25 in value.</li>
      <li>Gifts must not be gift cards. Get creative, you jerk.</li>
      <li>Gifts must not be gag gifts or generic in nature. That’s not how Santa does things.</li>
      <li>Gifts must be wrapped. Don’t be a grinch.</li>
      <li>Gifts must not be labeled with who they are from, only who they are for.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You have until Friday, December 7th at midnight to accept this invitation, or you will not be included in the automatic secret santa match.</p>

    <p>We hope to hear from you soon. Good luck.</p>

    <p>— Josh Ferrara &amp; the S3</p>
