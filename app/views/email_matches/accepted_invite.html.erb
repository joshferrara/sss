    <h1>Greetings, <%= @user.first_name %></h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations. You're officially a member of the S3. We knew you'd make the right choice.</p>
    <p>We don't have much information for you right now, but we can tell you that our annual secret meeting this year will take place at LOCATION_GOES_HERE, at 7PM on Saturday, December 15th.</p>
    <p>On Friday, December 7th at midnight, you will receive a secret santa match name. Once you receive your match name, you can begin finding and purchasing the perfect gift for them.</p>
    <p>That's all the information I have for you until the 15th at midnight. Until then, remember: we DO NOT talk about Secret Santa Society.

    <p>â€” Josh Ferrara &amp; the S3</p>
